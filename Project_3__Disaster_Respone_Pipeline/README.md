# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

## Context

Deploying disaster-response NLP message classifier to a web app using Heroku.

The output can be found [here](https://pgs-worldbank-app.herokuapp.com/).

The source code for the app itself is not currently held in this repo, as Heroku requires the app to be in the repo base folder, so it is in its own repo [here](https://github.com/paul-stubley/first_web_app) and also pushed to a Heroku remote (see .git/config for details of both remotes)
