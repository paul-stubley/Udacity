# Context

This project covered the foundations of OOP including: 
- creating a class, and two daughter-classes
- packaging the package correctly
- uploading to PyPi (I left mine at test-PyPi, rather than cluttering the PyPi index)

The folder `example_package` contains everything needed to use as a template for future python packages.
This folder contains the file `Instructions...` which details how to take the contents of `example_package`, upload them to PyPi as a package, and install that package using `pip`

The uploaded package can be found at https://test.pypi.org/project/pgs-dsnd-distributions
