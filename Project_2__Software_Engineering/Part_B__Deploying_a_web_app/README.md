# Context

Covers the foundations of HTML, css, javascript, bootstrap, plotly (JS and Python) and deploying a web app using Heroku.

The output can be found [here](https://pgs-worldbank-app.herokuapp.com/).  This is extremely basic at the moment, I hope to build a more interesting app soon.

The source code for the app itself is not currently held in this repo, as Heroku requires the app to be in the repo base folder, so it is in its own repo [here](https://github.com/paul-stubley/first_web_app) and also pushed to a Heroku remote (see .git/config for details of both remotes)
