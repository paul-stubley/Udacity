# Context

Covers the foundations of HTML, css, javascript, bootstrap, plotly (JS and Python) and deploying a web app using Heroku.

The output can be found [here](https://pgs-worldbank-app.herokuapp.com/).  This is extremely basic at the moment, I hope to build a more interesting app soon.

The source code for the app itself is not currently held here as it's in its own git repo used for Heroku
