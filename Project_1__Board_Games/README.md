This folder contains the input, output and notebook files for the first project of the Udacity Data Scientist NanoDegree program (Term 2).

The key notebook file is `Board_Games.ipynb`.
It uses a data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mshepherd/board-games), stored in the `BGG.csv` file.
It also requires two json dictionaries, `categories.json` & `mechanics.json`
There are several graphical outputs saved here, which are used in the [Medium Post](https://medium.com/p/c31340859bef) describing this work.
