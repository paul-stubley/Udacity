# Udacity
This repo contains work towards the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Data Science NanoDegree.  It is work in progress split by Project.

## Project 1 - Intro to DS
<a href="https://medium.com/@paulgstubley/bored-games-c31340859bef?source=friends_link&sk=ed9a21aa4b75262a4a46b7dec87a9df6" target="_blank"><img alt="Medium logo" src="images/medium.png" align="right" height="45px"></a> Covers Exploratory Data analysis of an interesting data set, a simple LinearRegression model fit, and creating content to upload to a Medium post.

## Project 2 - Software Engineering
### Introduction to OOP
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pgs-climbing/" target="_blank"><img alt="PyPi logo" src="images/pypi.png" align="right" height="45px"></a>
Covers the foundations of OOP including:
- creating a class, and two daughter-classes
- packaging the package correctly
- uploading to PyPi (I left mine at test-PyPi, rather than cluttering the PyPi index, but I uploaded my [Climbing](https://github.com/paul-stubley/Climbing) package to Pypi to test these new skills)

### Introduction to Web Development

<a href="https://pgs-ny-collisions.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="Heroku logo" src="images/heroku.jpg" align="right" height="45px"></a>
Covers the foundations of HTML, css, javascript, bootstrap, plotly (JS and Python) and deploying a Flask app using Heroku.

The output can be found [here](https://pgs-worldbank-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Project 3 - Data Engineering

### Disaster Response ML pipeline & App

This project covers the ETL & ML pipelines for a disaster recovery app, as well as deploying as a local Flask app.

Taking labelled direct messages, and those from social-media & news, at the time of a disaster, can we classify unlabelled messages into categories (e.g. Fire, Infrastrucure, Medical Assistance etc.) to pass on to emergency & support services.

## Project 4 - Experimental Design & Recommendations

## Project 5 - Capstone Project

## ToDo

- Upload Project 4 Parts 1 & 2
- Optimise 4.1 Starbucks task
- Create class for Recommender (and upload to PyPi?)
- Add hero images to this readme
