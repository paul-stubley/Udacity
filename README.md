# Udacity

This repo contains work towards the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Data Science NanoDegree.  It is work in progress split by Project.

## Project 1 - Intro to DS
Covers Exploratory Data analysis of an interesting data set, a simple LinearRegression model fit, and creating content to upload to a Medium post.

## Project 2 - Software Engineering

Covers the foundations of OOP including:
- creating a class, and two daughter-classes
- packaging the package correctly
- uploading to PyPi (I left mine at test-PyPi, rather than cluttering the PyPi index)

## Project 3 - Data Engineering

## Project 4 - Experimental Design & Recommendations

## Project 5 - Capstone Project
